//BUG 1
Adding a new serie with the value of 1, and the key in qoutation marks ("") 
caused the program to interpret the value as 10

Could not reproduce this in the test space, so need more data before making any changes.

//BUG 2
if a full match fails, and there are two series with a partial match, --dir-as-name 
will display both of them, this means that PlayNext.sh will get the wrong number.

--dir-as-name, should maybe only return one match, or add a flag.
and maybe 2 letter match should not be enough to be considered a match.

//Oversight
Adding a serie with episode 0, will cause PlayNext.sh script to select the
latest episode in the folder, maybe change it so when adding a serie
without a number it will default to 1, the same with when trying to add 0,

Negatives I do not know how to handle, in that case user error i guess.
